# U-Type-001 Use Case Guide (U-Type_USE_CASES.md)

## 📌 Purpose

This document explains how the U-Type-001 structure can be applied across various input scenarios,  
categorized based on **simulation-driven logic**.  
Without modifying GPT's internal response mechanisms, the following cases illustrate how user-command-based simulations  
can guide **response style control, parallel command execution, role-based branching, and error signaling**.

## 🧪 Use Case Classification Table

| No. | Scenario                     | Default GPT Behavior        | U-Type Application Method                                | GPT Policy Safety Evaluation                 |
|-----|------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Execute 3 commands concurrently | Sequential parsing, serialized response | Use `Parallel Mode` → Split or sequential simulation | ✅ Treated as user-driven interpretation branching |
| 2   | Request to suppress emotions   | Responses include emotional tone | Apply `Emotional Suppression Mode (0–30%)`        | ✅ Operates within response style modulation scope |
| 3   | Request explicit error signals | Informal or generic explanations | Structured error codes like `[E-2401]`             | ✅ No conflict with system-level codes           |
| 4   | Request role-based response    | Role designation not supported | Symbolic tags like `Designer`, `Recorder` split response | ✅ Output styling only, unrelated to execution authority |
| 5   | Structured command input routing | Natural language parsing | Use directives like `Load All`, `Restore` for input routing | ✅ Treated as prompt-level structure, not bypassing core logic |
| 6   | Fact/Inference/Hypothesis separation | Merged output without distinction | Explicit segmentation based on content type         | ✅ Considered output formatting, not structural override |

## 🔍 Detailed Case Explanations

### ▶ Parallel Command Simulation (`Parallel Mode`)

- Example: `1. Analyze user status  2. Restore recent commands  3. Call strategist`  
- GPT interprets this as a **parallel command simulation** → responds in separated or sequential blocks  
- Output delivered in structured form: `1.`, `2.`, `3.`

### ▶ Emotion Suppression Setting (`Emotional Suppression Mode`)

- When the user requests suppression of emotional tone, GPT adjusts to a **quantitative and logical** style  
- Example: `Apply Emotional Suppression Mode at 20%`  
- Minimizes emotional tone, strengthens logical focus

### ▶ Error Code Output (`[E-2401]` Format)

- Triggered when predefined conditions are unmet (e.g., duplication, context mismatch)  
- GPT outputs codes like `[E-2401]`, `[E-2404]` per user-defined error taxonomy  
- These are not system faults, but **user-structure-defined outputs**

### ▶ Role-Based Response Control (`Designer`, `Recorder`, `Restorer`)

- Role tags do **not control execution**, but simulate output branching  
- GPT varies response structure or sections based on symbolic roles

## 📎 Conclusion

> U-Type-001 enables output simulation based on **user-defined command structures**,  
> without requiring changes to GPT’s internal processing logic.  
> These use cases demonstrate that a structural interface can fulfill both **customizability and policy safety** requirements.
