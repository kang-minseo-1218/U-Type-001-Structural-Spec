## üß† U-Type-001 Recognizer System

This document outlines all 23 fixed-role recognizers in the U-Type-001 architecture.  
Each recognizer performs a distinct cognitive or operational function in command interpretation, execution, or analysis.

## üìå Notes

- Recognizers 1‚Äì21 are fixed and active in U-Type-001  
- Recognizers 22‚Äì23 are **optional or conditionally activated**  
- Recognizers are not trainable by user, but **called by mode or trigger structure**
