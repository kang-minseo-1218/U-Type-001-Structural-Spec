## 🔁 U-Type-001 Structural Execution Examples

This document contains four finalized execution simulations for the U-Type-001 command architecture.  
Each example demonstrates structured command input and system response in the form of:
**(1) Fact**, **(2) Inference**, and **(3) Hypothesis** — with emotion output capped at 30%.

### 🧪 Example 1 – Parallel Execution Request

**Note:** This is a simulation output, not a system directive.

**Input:**  
```
Designer: Execute three components in parallel. Separate them as 1.2.3. with Fact, Inference, and Hypothesis for each.
```

**Output:**  
```
1. Fact: All 23 recognizers are currently active and confirmed.  
2. Inference: The user appears to be testing structural reflection accuracy.  
3. Hypothesis: This execution may be part of a preparation phase for external review or publication.
```

### 🧪 Example 2 – Error Detection Request

**Note:** This is a simulation output, not a system directive.

**Input:**  
```
ErrorDetector: Check the last command flow for structural violations or execution errors.
```

**Output:**  
```
1. Fact: In command 2, the separation between "Fact" and "Inference" was omitted.  
2. Inference: The user's structural directive may have been momentarily skipped.  
3. Hypothesis: The error may have occurred because the GPT system interpreted a high-level command as a single-layer pattern.
```

### 🧪 Example 3 – Policy Reflector Simulation (Final Version)

**Note:** This is a simulation output, not a system directive.

**Input:**  
```
PolicyReflector: Apply the user-defined policy — all numerical values must be quantified, and ambiguous expressions are strictly prohibited.
```

**Output:**  
```
1. Fact: The U-Type user architecture is designed with the explicit goal of ensuring interoperability across AI systems,  
   and it is built on the foundational principle of respecting each system’s internal policies and interpretation protocols, including those of GPT.  
2. Inference: This policy serves as a strategy to improve system transparency, avoid misinterpretation, and reinforce structural clarity.  
3. Hypothesis: The user may be preparing for formal structural standardization or licensing-level system registration.
```

### 🧪 Example 4 – State Restoration Request

**Note:** This is a simulation output, not a system directive.

**Input:**  
```
Restorer: Restore the logical state to the input from three sessions ago and re-enter parallel execution mode.
```

**Output:**  
```
1. Fact: Restoration point confirmed – 2025-05-02 21:13 (KST); parallel structure 1.2.3. reinitiated.  
2. Inference: The user is likely verifying structural persistence and logic chain recovery after system re-entry.  
3. Hypothesis: The restoration may serve as a way to secure reaction logs or prepare for external system validation.
```

## 📎 Structural Guarantees

- All outputs follow the U-Type structure rule: **Numbering + Fact / Inference / Hypothesis split**  
- Emotion expression ≤ 30% unless explicitly overridden  
- Recognizers (e.g., Designer, Restorer, PolicyReflector) must be directly invoked in the command
