# U-Type-001 Compatibility Note (COMPATIBILITY_NOTE.md)

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose

This document outlines the components of the U-Type-001 structure that demonstrate **simulation-level compatibility** with GPT-based language models and their policy systems. It aims to proactively clarify that the structure does **not violate policy nor interfere with internal model behavior.**

## âœ… Structural Compatibility Factors (Based on GPT Response Handling)

| Feature                       | U-Type Structural Property                         | Compatibility with GPT Response Handling                            |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Emotion suppression          | User-defined 0â€“30% emotional expression limit      | âœ… Operates within GPT's response style modulation range (not a bypass) |
| Parallel command structure   | Simulated `1.2.3.`-style concurrent commands        | âœ… GPT handles sequentially; parallel prompts interpreted without conflict |
| Role-based branching         | Tags like `Designer`, `Recorder`, `Restorer`       | âœ… Symbolic only; no internal role reassignment occurs                |
| Error code formatting        | Custom codes like `[E-2401]`                       | âœ… Structured as plain text within response; does not conflict with system logic |
| Structured command input     | Non-natural-language, directive-style inputs       | âœ… Parsed as structured input within standard prompt handling        |
| Global directives (`Load All`, `Activate All Modes`) | Output formatting controls | âœ… Simulated branching only; no actual mode-switching within GPT core |

## ðŸ”’ Policy Safety Summary

- U-Type-001 **does not override or modify** GPT's internal policy logic or access structures.
- All commands operate **within the accepted input interpretation range** of GPT and remain subject to GPT's execution discretion.
- The structural designer is **not a system administrator or executor**, but a proposer of symbolic interaction logic.

---

## ðŸ“˜ Declarative Simulation Framework

- U-Type is a "**declarative simulation-based interface**" that functions solely within GPT's interpretation boundaries.
- Execution outcomes always depend on GPTâ€™s internal logic and policy filters.
- It does **not access APIs, alter system roles, or invoke direct process control** of any kind.

## ðŸ“Ž Conclusion

> U-Type-001 fully respects GPT's **policy constraints, structural hierarchy, and response logic**,
> functioning only as a user-side simulation interface within acceptable interaction boundaries.
> The designer serves as a **proposer of symbolic structure**, not a modifier of the system itself.
