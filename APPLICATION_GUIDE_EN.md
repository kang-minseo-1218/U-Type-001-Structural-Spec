# U-Type-001 Application Guide (Revised & Policy-Safe Version)

## 📀 Overview

U-Type-001 is an interface designed to simulate **structured command-driven interaction patterns** alongside GPT-series language models.  
This architecture transforms natural language into structured commands to support **user-defined simulation environments** for managing response styles, symbolic roles, and concurrent command operations.  
Its structure is conceptually alignable with typical layers observed in GPT input processing pipelines.

## 🧩 Applicable Simulation Layers (Conceptual Mapping Reference)

### 1. 🔹 Instruction Flow Simulation Layer

- The parallel command syntax (`1.2.3.`) and symbolic mode tags (e.g., `Designer`, `Recorder`) can be interpreted as **simulated user flows** resembling instruction routing patterns.
- Supports experimentation with user-controlled command priority, branching, and modular execution styles.

### 2. 🔹 Prompt Interpretation Layer

- U-Type commands follow a **structured command format** rather than free-form language, allowing **rule-based parsing simulations**.
- The explicit separation of Fact / Inference / Hypothesis facilitates structured interpretive modeling.

### 3. 🔹 Behavior Response Policy Simulation

- Emotion suppression threshold (0–30%), structured error code output, and format control can be simulated as **customized behavioral policy scenarios**.
- Suitable for controlled environments such as structured response testing or UI demonstration simulations.

## 🧪 Example: Simulation-Based Use Cases

| Scenario              | Standard Prompt Use       | U-Type Structure (Simulated)                                            |
|----------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Execute 3 commands    | Sequential only           | `Parallel Mode`: Concurrent execution with split responses              |
| Emotional suppression | Not natively supported    | Emotion regulation via `Emotional Suppression Mode (0–30%)`             |
| Error handling        | Informal error reporting  | Structured format output like `[E-2401]`                                |
| Role assignment       | Static role behavior only | Symbolic routing using `Designer`, `Recorder` (user-defined, simulated) |

## 🛡️ Safety & Policy Considerations

- U-Type-001 is a **user-side structural simulation** and does **not override, intercept, or bypass** any GPT-internal logic or model constraints.
- Features such as role-based routing, emotion modulation, and structural output formatting are intended to support **clarity, modularity, and simulation testing**.
- All behaviors remain within GPT’s standard input/output constraints and serve **only as guided interaction patterns** defined by the user.
