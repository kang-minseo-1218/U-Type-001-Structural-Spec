# U-Type-001 Application Guide (English Version)

## 📌 Overview
U-Type-001 is an interface designed to simulate structured command-based interactions with GPT-series language models.
This architecture transforms natural language into structured commands, enabling user-defined simulation environments that control response formats, role-based execution flows, and parallel command operations.
It is structurally compatible with various GPT model subsystems.

## 🧩 Applicable Integration Layers (Simulation-Level Reference)

### 1. 🔹 Instruction Routing Layer
- The parallel command syntax (`1.2.3.`) and mode assignments (e.g., `Designer`, `Recorder`) can be integrated as **user-defined flow simulations** within instruction routing logic.
- Supports prioritization of instructions, concurrent parsing, and role-based execution splitting.

### 2. 🔹 Prompt Parsing Layer
- U-Type commands are not free-form natural language but **structured command inputs**, which allows rule-based prompt parsing simulations.
- The separation of Fact / Inference / Hypothesis enhances interpretive precision.

### 3. 🔹 Custom Behavior Policy Layer
- Components such as emotional suppression threshold (0–30%), error code output, and structured response formatting support **custom response policy simulation**.
- Applicable to experimental or demonstration environments with response policy flexibility.

## 🧪 Simulation-Based Use Case Examples

| Scenario | Standard Input Method | U-Type (Simulation-based) |
|---------|-----------------------|----------------------------|
| Execute 3 commands | Sequential only | `Parallel Mode` enables concurrent execution with separated responses |
| Emotional suppression | Not supported | Response emotions limited via `Emotional Suppression Mode (0–30%)` |
| Error handling | Informal messages | Structured error output in form `[E-2401]` etc. |
| Role assignment | Static GPT role | Dynamic routing using `Designer`, `Recorder`, etc. user-defined modes |

## 🛡️ Safety & Policy Considerations

- U-Type operates as a **user-driven structured command simulation** and does not override or bypass model-internal rules or policies.
- Features like emotion control, error reporting, and role assignment are aimed at **enhancing system clarity and interpretability**.
- All actions remain strictly within the bounds of GPT's input processing and user-defined execution scope.
