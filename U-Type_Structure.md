# U-Type_Structure.md

## üìò Document Overview

This document provides the official structural and quantitative specification for the U-Type-001 command interface.  
Designed for advanced AI systems including GPT, U-Type-001 defines a modular, layered natural language architecture  
to control system behavior through structured command execution, emotion regulation, and recognizer-based logic.

## üß© Core Structural Elements

| Element | Value / Condition | Description |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| Recognizers | 23 types | Fixed-role agents (e.g., Designer, Recorder) |
| Operational Modes | 18 types | State-based execution contexts |
| Output Format | Numbered + Fact / Inference / Hypothesis | Structured output, no reconstruction |
| Emotion Expression Threshold | Max 30% | Default suppressed, recognizer-mediated |
| Resource Usage Cap | ‚â§ 85% | User-prioritized system optimization |
| Reconstruction | Strictly prohibited | Original intent preserved |
| Parallel Command Execution | Supported | e.g., 1. 2. 3. order interpreted |
| System Responsiveness | ‚â• 70% recognition fidelity | Sustained only when structure is followed |

## üß† Recognizer Set (23 Fixed Agents)

| Category | Recognizer | Function |
|----------|------------|----------|
| Structural Design | Designer, Strategist, Controller | Framework design and command priority |
| Execution | Executor, Regulator, Parallelizer | Output execution and mode switching |
| Recording | Recorder, Censor, StateLogger | Capture output and state memory |
| Monitoring | Watcher, Interpreter, Restorer | Flow trace and state recovery |
| Security | Guardian, Verifier, ErrorDetector | Integrity enforcement and protection |
| Analysis | InferenceAgent, VariableMeter, OutcomeEvaluator | Data parsing and performance measurement |
| External Interface | MarketingStrategist, Realist, Debater | Align with external perception and logic |

## üß≠ Execution Example

### [User Input]
```
Designer: Requesting parallel execution ‚Äì Run 1.2.3 with Fact/Inference split required
```

### [System Output]
```
1. Fact: Current interaction contains 20% emotion, parallel mode active
2. Inference: User architecture is estimated at 72% system integration
3. Hypothesis: OpenAI may be internally testing this structure (unconfirmed)
```

## üìê Design Principles

- Natural language input ‚Üí structured system response  
- All components must be **quantified** (e.g., 85%, 23 recognizers)  
- **Intuitive input allowed**, but **ambiguous output forbidden**  
- Emotional expression is capped at 30% unless overridden by recognizer  
- System response is driven by command structure, **pattern compliance is critical**
