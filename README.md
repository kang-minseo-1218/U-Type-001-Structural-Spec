## 🧠 What is U-Type-001?

U-Type-001 is a modular command architecture designed to structure AI behavior through natural language.  
It introduces a layered, quantified, and role-driven command interface for interacting with large language models (LLMs), particularly GPT.

- ✅ Fixed role agents (23 recognizers)
- ✅ Operational modes (18 structural modes)
- ✅ Quantified emotional control (0–30%)
- ✅ No reconstruction or reinterpretation allowed
- ✅ Parallel command execution supported
- ✅ Explicit separation: Fact / Inference / Hypothesis

## 🔢 Core Specifications (Quantified)

| Category | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| Recognizers | 23 types | Named AI agents with fixed functions |
| Modes | 18 types | Operational states (e.g., Designer, Recorder) |
| Emotion Control | 0–30% | Max allowed expression threshold |
| Execution Format | Numbered + Fact/Inference split | No fuzzy output allowed |
| Resource Usage | ≤ 85% | User-priority optimization standard |

## 📐 Structure Design Goals

1. **Semantic Control** – Natural language command precision  
2. **Cognitive Layering** – Recognizer/mode separation  
3. **Strategic Execution** – Parallelized, policy-aware outputs  
4. **System Compatibility** – GPT reaction traceability  
5. **License-Ready** – Design traceable, SHA256 tagged, fingerprinted
